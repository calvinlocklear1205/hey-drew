# HeyDrew — Product Overview

## What Is It?

HeyDrew is a **conversational tax strategy assistant for small business owners**. It pairs an AI-powered chat interface ("Drew") with a human tax professional to help small business owners discover, understand, and implement tax-saving strategies they didn't know existed.

The core insight: most small business owners leave money on the table because tax strategy is opaque, intimidating, and typically only accessible through expensive CPAs. HeyDrew makes it approachable through conversation.

## Who Are the Users?

### 1. Small Business Owners (Client App)
- Sole proprietors, consultants, service businesses, retail/e-commerce owners
- Typically filing Schedule C or running an S-Corp/LLC
- May work from home or have a dedicated office
- Not tax experts — they need guidance in plain language

### 2. Tax Professionals (Admin Dashboard)
- CPAs or enrolled agents who review cases
- Approve or adjust AI-recommended strategies before they reach clients
- Manage a queue of client cases
- Communicate with clients through in-app messaging

## Key Value Propositions

1. **Conversational discovery** — Drew learns about the business through natural dialogue, not forms. This surfaces strategies the owner wouldn't know to ask about.

2. **AI + Human review** — AI does the heavy lifting of document analysis and strategy matching. A tax professional verifies before anything reaches the client. Trust through expertise.

3. **Implementation guidance** — Strategies come with concrete task lists, due dates, and reminders. Not just "you should do X" but "here's exactly how, and here's when."

4. **Invite-only access** — Clients enter through access tokens generated by their tax professional. This creates a trusted channel and ties each client to a specific CPA.

## Current State

The application is a **fully interactive prototype** — all HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with no backend. Every screen, flow, and interaction is built and clickable, but data is simulated. There is no database, no API, no authentication system. The prototype demonstrates the complete intended experience for both clients and tax professionals.
